## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Data Layer**: Direct GraphQL integration with external Hasura endpoint
- **Data Storage**: No local database - all data fetched from external GraphQL API
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage for development
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **Schema Definition**: Centralized in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM
- **User Management**: Complete user table with authentication fields matching Hasura Auth structure
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for input/output validation derived from Drizzle schemas
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit with PostgreSQL dialect

### API Layer
- **User Management**: Full CRUD operations for users
- **Dashboard Stats**: Aggregated statistics endpoint
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- **Request Logging**: Custom middleware for API request/response logging
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation on all endpoints

### Storage Abstraction
- **Interface-based Design**: `IStorage` interface allows for multiple implementations
- **In-Memory Storage**: `MemStorage` class for development and testing
- **Database Storage**: Designed to be easily swapped with actual database implementation

### Frontend Components
- **Layout**: Sidebar navigation with topbar for page-specific content
- **Dashboard**: Statistics overview with cards and charts
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD interface with modals and data tables
- **Reusable UI**: Comprehensive component library from shadcn/ui
- **Form Components**: Standardized modals for create/edit operations

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query for data fetching
2. **API Routing**: Express.js routes handle HTTP requests with validation
3. **Business Logic**: Service layer (storage interface) processes requests
4. **Data Persistence**: Drizzle ORM manages database operations
5. **Response**: JSON responses with proper error handling and status codes

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL driver for Neon
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management for React
- **react-hook-form**: Form handling with validation
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Zod integration for form validation

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **lucide-react**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **typescript**: Static type checking
- **vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with HMR
- **API Development**: tsx for running TypeScript server code directly
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for schema changes and migrations

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Environment-based DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Deployment**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection
- **Build Scripts**: Separate build and start commands for production
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets in production
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for scalability

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code. The shared directory contains database schemas and types used by both frontend and backend, ensuring type safety across the entire application.
